Jupi 0.11

Author: Leo Szumel

Description:
  A script to post files from the command line.

Usage:
  "jupi file1 [...]"
  "jupi dir1 [...]"
  A TinyURL is printed to the console. Send that link to your friend(s).

Options:
  -bigurl   skip the TinyURL call
  -clip     copy URL to the clipboard (broken)

Installation:
  Put jupi in a good place (e.g. /usr/local/bin)
  Create a ~/.jupirc according to directions in jupi

Bugs:
  -clip option currently not working; it would place the URL in the clipboard.

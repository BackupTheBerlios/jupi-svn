Description: easy way to get files from command line to the web
 Problem: you are on the command line and want to send a file (or
 set of files) to a friend with minimum fuss.
 .
 Solution: jupi your files. jupi creates smart thumbnails of your
 files, posts them to a web server, and gives you a tinyurl suitable
 for email or IM.
 .
 Why not just use email? First, calling jupi is easier (especially if
 you have a large set of files). Second, email attachments have size
 limits. Third, if you're sending to multiple recipients, the Right
 Thing to Do is to send a link, not a file.
